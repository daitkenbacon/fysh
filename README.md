# Fysh

A website for fishing tournaments.

## Description


Fysh allows users to create, join, and participate in fishing tournaments.  
Each tournament has a registration fee, maximum number of participants, and basic info / rules / start and end dates.  
Fyshers compete by submitting their catches whilst the tournament is open, and the host judges the winner at tournament end.  
(This started as a POC for a startup, and turned into a personal project.)
